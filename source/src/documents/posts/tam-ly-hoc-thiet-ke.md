# WHAT

Interaction between people and product, system they use
Understandable -> know **the way people think** and process the information, it simple like green to go and red for stop
Make thing so obvious, come naturally **without any instruction** no room for confuse

As a designer you need to understand how humans think and work or your designs are going to fall down. It’s not something that is inherently separate from design; it’s just that all designers should have some basic psychology to be able to design for human beings. If you’re interested in designing for human beings, you need to understand how human beings work.

## The Role of Psychology and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in UX design (Ergonomics)



# WHY
If you don’t understand physics and you go to build a building, the building is just going to fall down

>> Meeting basic usability standards is crucial for any successful product these days

# HOW
### Hick-Hyman Law

**the time it takes for a person to make a decision depends on the choices available to him**

![Hick’s Law Example](https://blog.marvelapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1WLT8LMUF7RqozfG38TIL3A.png)
## Von Restorff effect
The Von Restorff effect (also known as the isolation effect) predicts that **when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered!**

>> call-to-action

![Von Restorff Effect Example](https://blog.marvelapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19hp1-4D43u4FUi9w5HTZzQ.png)

## Serial position effect

**the propensity of a user to best remember the first and last items in a series.**
![From left to right, Twitter, Medium, ProductHunt](https://blog.marvelapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1CpPcu45_U03GXNeJ9PKo7A.png)

## Cognitive load
the difficulty associated with a specific instructional topic

**the amount of thought you need to exercise in order to complete a specific task**

### Intrinsic cognitive load
![From left to right, Stayful, Serist, Lucidchart](https://blog.marvelapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/10dupJKct795FFvJnJchbEA.png)
### Extraneous cognitive load



## Law of Proximity

**objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together**

### Fitts' Law
### The Gestalt Laws and Interface Design
### Germane cognitive load
it’s easier for the users to recognise and learn something new if they can discern it into a pattern from something they already understand

# HOW

## Some sample patterns from https://www.goodui.org

![COUPON FIELDS OR NOT](https://www.goodui.org/images/ds_patternsample.png)

- **One Column** Layout vs. Multicolumns
> A one column layout will give you more control over your narrative. It should be able to guide your readers in a more predictable way from top to bottom
> A multi column approach runs some additional risk of being distracting to the core purpose of a page

![Try A One Column Layout instead of multicolumns.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea001.png)

- Try **Merging Similar Functions** instead of fragmenting the UI.
> Keep an eye out for duplicate functionality labelled in various ways, as it puts a strain on your customers
> Consider refactoring your UI once in a while by merging similar functions together.
![Try Merging Similar Functions instead of fragmenting the UI](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea003.png)

- Try **Social Proof** instead of talking about yourself.
> A great way to reinforce a call to action
![Try Social Proof instead of talking about yourself.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea004.png)

- Try **Recommending** instead of showing equal choices.
> try emphasizing and highlighting certain options above others
![Try Recommending instead of showing equal choices.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea007.png)

- Try **Undos** instead of prompting for confirmation
> Most of the time human actions are intended and only in small situations are they accidental
> Consider making your users feel more in control by enabling the ability to undo actions and not asking for confirmation where possible
![Try Undos instead of prompting for confirmation.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea008.png)

- Try Telling Who It's For instead of targeting everyone.
> This is a conversion idea where you could be explicit about who exactly your product or service is intended for
> By communicating the qualifying criteria of your customers, you might be able to actually connect more with them while at the same time hinting at a feeling of exclusivity
![](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea009.png)

- Try Personality instead of being generic
> stating where your product is being made at also has a pretty good chance of making it feel of slightly higher quality
> Introducing yourself or your product with a name, picture or place of origin
![Try Personality instead of being generic](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea012.png)

- Try Fewer Form Fields instead of asking for too many.
> Human beings are inherently resistant to labor intensive tasks
> Each field you ask for runs the risk of making your visitors turn around and give up
> Not everyone types at the same speed, while typing on mobile devices is still a chore in general
> Question if each field is really necessary and remove as many fields as possible
![Try Fewer Form Fields instead of asking for too many.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea013.png)

- Try Exposing Options instead of hiding them.
> Try to reserve pull down menus for options that are predictable and don’t require new learning as in sets of date and time references (ex: calendars) or geographic sets
> Be careful of using drop downs for primary items that are on your path to conversion. 
![Try Exposing Options instead of hiding them.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea014.png)

- Try Suggesting Continuity instead of false bottoms.
> Scrolling long pages are great
> Be careful of giving your visitors a sense that the page has come to an end somewhere in between sections where it really hasn't
![Try Suggesting Continuity instead of false bottoms.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea015.png)



# The State of UX in 2017

## Usability becomes a commodity

>> Design patterns are still a thing — a big thing. 

More and more, designers can rely on robust and comprehensive **interaction pattern libraries** for **solving common design use cases**

>> You don’t need to reinvent the wheel when designing a door handle. 

Innovation just for innovation’s sake, like trying to create a completely disruptive navigation system for your website or app, can bring usability problems in the long term. 

It all comes down to: what exactly is the user need you’re trying to solve by introducing a new interaction pattern?

Luckily, interaction design pattern **libraries** and **guidelines** are helping keep designers honest and focused on what really matters for the user: *getting things done in an easy and familiar way*.

Although someone in the room will always feel entitled to raise their hand and argue Snapchat is not the most “intuitive” experience ever, yet is still successful.

Why choose to use Gmail over Yahoo, Medium over Blogger, the features are 99% the same -> It’s about that additional layer of sophistication that can only be achieved when you put enough time and brainpower into the tiniest details, the most subtle animations, the most elegant transitions.

Should not be afraid of starting from design patterns to cover the basics,  and then focusing the bulk of their time on the details that will make experiences feel more relevant, delightful — and therefore more memorable.

## The words we will stop using

Do you still need to sell your design as “mobile-friendly”?
Do you still describe experiences as being “intuitive”?
