# WHAT

Interaction between people and product, system they use
Understandable -> know **the way people think** and process the information, it simple like green to go and red for stop
Make thing so obvious, come naturally **without any instruction** no room for confuse

As a designer you need to understand how humans think and work or your designs are going to fall down. It’s not something that is inherently separate from design; it’s just that all designers should have some basic psychology to be able to design for human beings. If you’re interested in designing for human beings, you need to understand how human beings work.

## The Role of Psychology and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in UX design (Ergonomics)


# WHY

If you don’t understand physics and you go to build a building, the building is just going to fall down

>> Meeting basic usability standards is crucial for any successful product these days

Prevent to re-work everytimes

# HOW

## Hick-Hyman Law

**the time it takes for a person to make a decision depends on the choices available to him**

![Hick’s Law Example](https://blog.marvelapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1WLT8LMUF7RqozfG38TIL3A.png)

## Von Restorff effect

The Von Restorff effect (also known as the isolation effect) predicts that **when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered!**

>> call-to-action

![Von Restorff Effect Example](https://blog.marvelapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19hp1-4D43u4FUi9w5HTZzQ.png)

## Serial position effect

**the propensity of a user to best remember the first and last items in a series.**

![From left to right, Twitter, Medium, ProductHunt](https://blog.marvelapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1CpPcu45_U03GXNeJ9PKo7A.png)

## Cognitive Load Theory (John Sweller)

![](https://learningsnippets.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/clt.jpg)
Helping people learn Effectively. In our brains, we have two types of memory. One is our working memory, which we use to process new information. The capacity of our working memory is quite limited so it can only handle so much before it becomes overloaded. The second is our long-term memory, which is where we store information from our working memory and where we retrieve that information from later. 

To assist learners in transferring information from their working memory to their long-term memory, we need to present the information in such a way that it reduces extraneous cognitive load (non-relevant items) and, if possible, increases germane cognitive load (items that assist with information processing)

![How Do We Process Information?](https://www.mindtools.com/media/Diagrams/CLT-Diagram-1a.jpg)

Refers to the total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory

Three types of cognitive load

-  Intrinsic - inherent demand of learning task, element interactivity
-  Extraneous - activities unrelated to learning
-  Germane - attention direct to activities that promote learning

They found that designers should do the following to assist learners in processing information:

- Present some information via the visual channel and some via the verbal channel.
- Break content into smaller segments and allow the learner to control the pace.
- Remove non-essential content – this includes background music and decorative pictures that don’t add value.
- Words should be placed close as possible to the corresponding graphics.
- Don’t narrate on-screen text.
- Synchronise visual and verbal content i.e. don’t place them on separate screens.

### Intrinsic cognitive load

Intrinsic cognitive load is the difficulty associated with a specific instructional topic. (Wiki)

It’s the main reason micro-copy and copy play a huge role in a good user experience.

Example most of the time on applications’ empty states, we prompt users to complete a task, here, the copy needs to be short, simple and with the appropriate words in order for the user to be able to easily follow the instructions
![From left to right, Stayful, Serist, Lucidchart](https://blog.marvelapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/10dupJKct795FFvJnJchbEA.png)

### Extraneous cognitive load

### Germane Cognitive Load

The cognitive load devoted to processing information and construction of schemas. The schemas describe a pattern of thought that organises categories of information and any relationships among them.

One of the reasons we use design patterns is because they’re something we’re programmed to do by default – so it’s easier for the users to recognise and learn something new if they can discern it into a pattern from something they already understand.

## Fitts' Law (Paul Fitts)
The importance of size and distance in UI design

Fitts's Law provides a model of human movement, established in 1954 by Paul Fitts, which can accurately predict the amount of time taken to move to and select a target

Apply?

## Command button
interactive element in the graphical user interface must be distinguished from other non-interactive elements by **size**

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Command_button.png)

## The outer edges and corners

The outer edges and corners of the graphical user interface can be acquired with greater speed than anywhere else in the display, due to the pinning action of the screen

![](https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/ux-daily/0647efb1fb85aa74921b8e427dcf2eac.jpg)


## The Gestalt Laws and Interface Design

### Law of Proximity

**objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together**
![](https://blog.marvelapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1Jn2VR9U2bNj8Nh2d8zf5ug.png)

![](http://architectingusability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Proximity_Form_1.png)

Conceptually, each label matches up with a corresponding text-entry field. And yet the labels are so far away from the text-entry fields that the labels appear to form their own group, and the fields appear to form another group. The connection between each label and its corresponding field isn’t perfectly obvious.
[](http://architectingusability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Proximity_Form_2.png)

### Law of closure

The mind fills in any gaps in incomplete shapes, to achieve closure in the form of a familiar shape.

In the following classic example, we perceive the image to be a circle, even though part of the circle is missing:

![](http://architectingusability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ClosureCircle_1.png)

## Design better forms

### Forms should be one column
![Forms should be one column](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*XhzxeTnAuWoaeJmlPBP0bw.jpeg)

### Top align labels
![Top align labels](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*tnR_OXAKMJW8S9cqRy416A.jpeg)

### Group labels with their inputs
![Group labels with their inputs](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*obwyjb54NCWy3sOPfm2WEg.jpeg)

### Avoid all caps
![Avoid all caps][https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*w6nZOf5pZSha6FoWu3YtRw.jpeg]
All caps is more difficult to read and scan.

### Show all selection options if under 6
![Show all selection options if under 6](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*VvQeOFsY57NJxtZmKyRnHA.jpeg)
Placing options in a selector drop-down requires two clicks, and hides the options. Use an input selector if there are over 5 options. Incorporate contextual search within the drop-down if there are over 25 options.

### Resist using placeholder text as labels
![Resist using placeholder text as labels](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*XvUnJwHtQhJ3Wl8Apj9lhQ.jpeg)

### Place checkboxes (and radios) underneath each other for scannability
![Place checkboxes (and radios) underneath each other for scannability
](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*VLqTEZP8OrH24FooksePbQ.jpeg)

### Make CTAs descriptive
![Make CTAs descriptive](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*VzlN4tj2hQRUel2iNzM9dw.jpeg)

### Specify errors inline
![Specify errors inline](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*-NXH_4cKK_ngIgrcqShTbg.jpeg)

### Use inline validation after the user fills out the field (unless it helps them while in the process)
![Use inline validation after the user fills out the field (unless it helps them while in the process)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*aGO8yGo2jqu9XgntfFvlsQ.jpeg)

### Don’t hide basic helper text
![Don’t hide basic helper text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*D2A7FGZdYdtt9YC1q7IAUw.jpeg)

### Differentiate primary from secondary actions
![Differentiate primary from secondary actions](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*STZ7rbj0wO5u2sn0bsR-KQ.jpeg)

### Use field length as an affordance
![Use field length as an affordance](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*3rOjyzcj68Dm7badROWuxg.jpeg)

The length of the field affords the length the answer. Employ this for fields that have a defined character count like phone numbers, zip codes, etc.

### Ditch the * and denote optional fields
![Ditch the * and denote optional fields](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*riNfOVAxTChvaQ29n-6IPQ.jpeg)
Users don’t always know what is implied by the required field marker (*). Instead, it is better to denote optional fields.

### Group related information
![Group related information](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nmeMIuW7csU9uVTB9BIBTg.jpeg)

WHY ASK?

Omit optional fields and think of other ways to collect data. Always ask yourself if the question can be inferred, postponed, or completely excluded

## Some sample patterns from https://www.goodui.org

![COUPON FIELDS OR NOT](https://www.goodui.org/images/ds_patternsample.png)

- **One Column** Layout vs. Multicolumns
> A one column layout will give you more control over your narrative. It should be able to guide your readers in a more predictable way from top to bottom
> A multi column approach runs some additional risk of being distracting to the core purpose of a page

![Try A One Column Layout instead of multicolumns.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea001.png)

- Try **Merging Similar Functions** instead of fragmenting the UI.
> Keep an eye out for duplicate functionality labelled in various ways, as it puts a strain on your customers
> Consider refactoring your UI once in a while by merging similar functions together.
![Try Merging Similar Functions instead of fragmenting the UI](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea003.png)

- Try **Social Proof** instead of talking about yourself.
> A great way to reinforce a call to action
![Try Social Proof instead of talking about yourself.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea004.png)

- Try **Recommending** instead of showing equal choices.
> try emphasizing and highlighting certain options above others
![Try Recommending instead of showing equal choices.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea007.png)

- Try **Undos** instead of prompting for confirmation
> Most of the time human actions are intended and only in small situations are they accidental
> Consider making your users feel more in control by enabling the ability to undo actions and not asking for confirmation where possible
![Try Undos instead of prompting for confirmation.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea008.png)

- Try Telling Who It's For instead of targeting everyone.
> This is a conversion idea where you could be explicit about who exactly your product or service is intended for
> By communicating the qualifying criteria of your customers, you might be able to actually connect more with them while at the same time hinting at a feeling of exclusivity
![](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea009.png)

- Try Personality instead of being generic
> stating where your product is being made at also has a pretty good chance of making it feel of slightly higher quality
> Introducing yourself or your product with a name, picture or place of origin
![Try Personality instead of being generic](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea012.png)

- Try Fewer Form Fields instead of asking for too many.
> Human beings are inherently resistant to labor intensive tasks
> Each field you ask for runs the risk of making your visitors turn around and give up
> Not everyone types at the same speed, while typing on mobile devices is still a chore in general
> Question if each field is really necessary and remove as many fields as possible
![Try Fewer Form Fields instead of asking for too many.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea013.png)

- Try Exposing Options instead of hiding them.
> Try to reserve pull down menus for options that are predictable and don’t require new learning as in sets of date and time references (ex: calendars) or geographic sets
> Be careful of using drop downs for primary items that are on your path to conversion. 
![Try Exposing Options instead of hiding them.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea014.png)

- Try Suggesting Continuity instead of false bottoms.
> Scrolling long pages are great
> Be careful of giving your visitors a sense that the page has come to an end somewhere in between sections where it really hasn't
![Try Suggesting Continuity instead of false bottoms.](http://www.goodui.org/images/idea015.png)

# Be Careful About These Web Design Trends

The decision to follow a trend must depend on the needs of your users and your business.

The decision should never be based solely on **“it’s what the cool sites are doing”**. Fads fade. A site built only on trends quickly becomes out of date.

Think twice about using

## Hiding everything under a Hamburer Menu

Example: Squarespace
![](http://www.awwwards.com/awards/gallery/2015/11/be-careful-trends-awwwards-09.png)

Desinger think: placing navigation under a hamburger menu makes a site cleaner sleeker.

Most people are familiar with this pattern, but this isn't something that work for every site and can reduce **discorverability**

The consequences can be harmful for e-commerce sites and news sites, where discoverability of topics and items *critical* to the experience.

![](http://www.awwwards.com/awards/gallery/2015/11/be-careful-trends-awwwards-03.png)
Example: Time's website
- Variety of news topics hidden in the hamburger menu.
- They combats the discoverability issue with a ticker on the left side of recent news stories and the search feature prominently atop the ticker

>> Even if the global navigation is difficult to design and hard to maintain, most sites will still be better off showing top-level categories to users right away. It's simply one of the most effective ways of helping users quickly understand what the site is about - Jennifer Cardello and Kathryn Whitenton

The use of icons instead of the standard text menus. You run the risk of confusing visitor when you don't literally spell it out for them. It's a risky game once you start making assumptions about people's interpretation of symbols

Visible menus have proven benefits, many of the biggest web companies have retired their humburger menus, in favour of something a bit more obvious

## Front-page Carousels

Carousels seem to be everywhere. A few things to consider:
- **Carousels are bad for SEO**. The lack of content means that it's difficult to get meta information into a page. Google, Bing no longer crawls meta keywords and take keyword information from the page.
- **Adversely affect performance**. often carousels contain high-res images that are under-optimized. The most importance page on the site should load *as quick as posible*
- **Pushes content down below the fold**. [Not recommended by Google][https://search.googleblog.com/2012/01/page-layout-algorithm-improvement.html]
- **Tends to be inaccessible**. Just [1% of people click on carousels][http://erikrunyon.com/2013/01/carousel-stats/]. Many simple ignore them and don't note the content. 

## Parallax scrolling

Any website with A decent budget is obliged to take the parallax approach. "Wow! that looks expensive!" - which may well be the first impression visitor get as well

Potential issues

- **Bad for SEO**. There's usually little in the way of content that can be crawled by the search engines.
- **Reduce performance** due to the heavy use of graphics and JavaScript. A headache for mobile users. Load times on mobile tends to be very poor when parallax is used
- **Affect users negatively**. [The Journal os Usability Studies][http://uxpajournal.org/the-effects-of-parallax-scrolling-on-user-experience-in-web-design/] carried out research on parallax which found that users experienced "motion sickness and experienced significant usability issues when interacting with the parallax website". There are *trade-offs* if you want to create a site that works on both desktop and mobile, then parallax really isn't for you.

## Complex Load Screens

[Users will bolt from a site that takes more than 10 seconds][https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/?wide=1]

Big, huge hero images, desinger think "Well, all we need is a super cool photo and a button".

Keep these hero images within the top section not take over the entire screen, also let users know that there is more below the image by using the arrow

## Flat Design

![](https://globalspex.com/web-design-features-already-outdated/flat-design/)

We couldn't figure out what was a button. It all started to blend together and nothing gave you an indication that something was interactive.

Use flat design include some dimension so you don't make things difficult for your users.

>>  you should reduce the amount of JavaScript you use so that it doesn’t make your site painful to view on a mobile device

## Sidebar

Depend on the topic and the purpose of the page, start remove sidebar on certain pages.

![](https://globalspex.com/web-design-features-already-outdated/sidebars/)
Example: FoxNews.com
Do you really need the weather on you sidebar? it's even showing New York weather?
Another reason that sidebars tend to lóe their effectiveness is on mobile. Sidebar are moved to the bottom of the screen anyway.

## Complex Typography

You can use multiple typefaces, I generally wouldn't recommend more than two.

## Infinite scrolling web pages

Website with infinite scrolling that never let users reach the footer. kept scrolling and loading. Would ever end?

[How infinitive scrolling breaks UX](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/11/how-infinite-scrolling-breaks-ux/)

## Greyer Grays

Instagram blew away the design world by redoing their app in black and white. We had never seen those two colors paired together in our entire lives.

Designer everywhere prefer gray over gray. If you still using gray this year, then start looking for another job.

>> visitors don’t care about how cool your site looks and whether it’s got fancy graphics or not…[they] care about…page-loading times

# The State of UX in 2017

## Usability becomes a commodity

>> Design patterns are still a thing — a big thing. 

>> Patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems. Design patterns are standard reference points for the experienced user interface designer.

More and more, designers can rely on robust and comprehensive **interaction pattern libraries** for **solving common design use cases**

### Don’t reinvent the wheel

>> You don’t need to reinvent the wheel when designing a door handle. 

Innovation just for innovation’s sake, like trying to create a completely disruptive navigation system for your website or app, can bring usability problems in the long term. 

If you don’t have time, or are not sure that you can build small components (like a dropdown) from scratch, ask your developer what library s/he suggests, and polish a pre-made version. One typical case is reinventing a datepicker. 

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Cgndb4fH9aXPnrLIuyuE4Q@2x.png)

Too many people think they just need to draw a calendar with numbers on it, but you also need to think about:
- Whether you will mark dates from the previous or next month.
- What the hover effect will be for each date.
- How you will mark the current date.
- How you will mark a picked date.
- How you will switch years or months.

It all comes down to: what exactly is the user need you’re trying to solve by introducing a new interaction pattern?

Luckily, interaction design pattern **libraries** and **guidelines** are helping keep designers honest and focused on what really matters for the user: *getting things done in an easy and familiar way*.

Although someone in the room will always feel entitled to raise their hand and argue Snapchat is not the most “intuitive” experience ever, yet is still successful.

## Pay more attention to microinteractions

[Dan Saffer’s book Microinteractions – Designing with Details][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CEtqnPdWoI]

Why choose to use Gmail over Yahoo, Medium over Blogger, the features are 99% the same -> It’s about that additional layer of sophistication that can only be achieved when you put enough time and brainpower into the tiniest details, the most subtle animations, the most elegant transitions.

Should not be afraid of starting from design patterns to cover the basics,  and then focusing the bulk of their time on the details that will make experiences feel more relevant, delightful — and therefore more memorable.

## The words we will stop using

Do you still need to sell your design as “mobile-friendly”?
Do you still describe experiences as being “intuitive”?

Back in 2011 everyone was talking about Responsive Design. It was the topic everyone was writing, reading, and tweeting about that year.

![Interest in the search term “Responsive Design” over time (source: Google Trends)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XegLLytw-qvrCOOW.)

- We don’t sell an experience as being “intuitive” — we prove it through user testing and positive feedback from customers.
- We don’t sell our process as being “human-centered”; it’s an assumption that any capable and successful company these days will bring users to the design process at some level and at some point in the project.
- 2016 was the year Google decided to remove the label “mobile friendly” from its search results, 85% of all pages in the mobile search results now meet the appropriate criteria and show the mobile-friendly label


## Everything is a conversation
